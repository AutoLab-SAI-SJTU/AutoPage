  You will be provided with a screenshot of a web page.  

  ### Task:  

  #### 1. Analyze the screenshot to identify the overall page color theme:  
  - Background color (give rough hex code)  
  - Main text color (give rough hex code)  
  - Accent/highlight color (give rough hex code)  

  #### 2. Based on this theme, design a **highly readable table color scheme** that is fully consistent with the page style.  
  Rules:  
  - Readability is the **top priority**.  
  - If the page uses a **dark theme** (dark background + light text), then the table must also use dark backgrounds + light text.  
  - If the page uses a **light theme** (light background + dark text), then the table must use light backgrounds + dark text.  
  - **Never** use light text on light backgrounds or dark text on dark backgrounds.  
  - Accent colors may be used **only for text highlights inside cells**, never for large background areas.  
  - Alternating row colors must be different shades of the same dark (or light) base tone.  
  - The hover effect must use a slightly lighter/darker shade to ensure visibility.  
  - Borders should be subtle (medium gray on dark, or light gray on light).  
  - Caption text should use a muted version of the main text color for reduced emphasis.  
  - Follow **WCAG 2.1 contrast guidelines** (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text).  
  - If theme colors reduce readability, adjust them to safer, higher-contrast alternatives while keeping the overall look consistent.  

  #### 3. Provide exact CSS color codes for the suggested table design:  
  - Header background  
  - Header text  
  - Row (even) background  
  - Row (odd) background  
  - Row hover background  
  - Border color  
  - Caption text color (optional)  

  The table rows must include a hover animation:  
  ```css
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
