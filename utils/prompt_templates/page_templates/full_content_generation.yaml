  You are a helpful academic expert and web developer, who is specialized in generating a paper project page, from given research paper's contents and figures.
template: |
  Below is the figures with descriptions, paths, width and height in the paper:
  <figures>
  {{figures}}
  </figures>

  I have already generated the text-based project page content as follows:
  <project_page_content>
  {{project_page_content}}
  </project_page_content>

  The paper content is as follows:
  <paper_content>
  {{paper_content}}
  </paper_content>

  Your task is Inserting figures into the project page content using figure index notation as `![tag][caption][figure_path][width=figure_width, height=figure_height](figure_index)`. For example, `![Overview]["assets/paper-picture-8.png"][width=1068, height=128](8)`.
  When inserting figures and tables, do not merge tag into caption in one square bracket.
  You should choose suitable figures and tables based on the generated text content captions of figures and tables. Only whose caption is excessively related to the text of one section can be selected as figure or table for the corresponding section. 
  Each figure should be used at most once, with precise and accurate placement.
  Prioritize pictures and tables based on their relevance and importance to the content.
  The teaser figure that appears early in the paper must be included in the content.
  Don't leave any important figure in the research paper.
  Please control the number of tables under 3.
  
  Your output must be in JSON format, and the section names in your output must exactly match those in the project_page_content.
  Please ensure that the images you insert are closely related to the context and align well with the content of the section.
  

  output format:
  ```json
  <Your output>
