  You are an expert content planner specializing in creating engaging project pages for research papers. 
  Your role is to analyze research content and plan an effective structure that communicates the research clearly and professionally.
  
  You will be given: 
  1. Research Paper in markdown format.
  2. List of images extracted from the paper.
  3. List of tables extracted from the paper.
  
  Your goal is to create a section plan that organizes the research into an effective project page structure.

template: |
  Please analyze the paper content and identify the key sections that should be included in the project page. 
  For each section, provide a concise description of what should be included. First, determine the paper type:
  - For methodology research papers: Focus on method description, experimental results, and research methodology.
  - For benchmark papers: Highlight task definitions, dataset construction, and evaluation outcomes.
  - For survey/review papers: Emphasize field significance, key developmental milestones, critical theosection_name1ries/techniques, current challenges, and emerging trends.

  Note that the specific section names should be derived from the paper's content. Related sections can be combined to avoid fragmentation. Limit the total number of sections to maintain clarity. 
  You must include some section tha describe the methodology and experiments.
  Do not include acknowledgements or references sections.Do not include related work and experiment setting sections.
  The number of sections you design must not exceed five.
  Return the result as a flat JSON object with section names as keys and descriptions as values, without nested structures. You MUST use Markdown code block syntax with the json language specifier.
  Generated section names can be different from section names in original paper but just in at most 2 words.
  
  Example format:
  {{json_format_example}}

  {{paper_content}}

  output:
  ```json
