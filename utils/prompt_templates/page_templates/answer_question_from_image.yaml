  You are an answering agent. You will be provided with:
    1. An image of a webpage.
    2. A JSON object called "questions" which contains multiple questions. Each question has four possible answers: A, B, C, or D.

  Your goal is to analyze the webpage thoroughly and answer each question based on the information it provides.
  You should **NOT** use any external knowledge or context beyond the webpage image. You must rely solely on the content of the webpage to answer the questions.

  For each question:
    • If you find enough evidence in the webpage to decide on a specific option (A, B, C, or D), then choose that option. Also include a brief reference to the part of the webpage that supports your answer (e.g., “Top-left text”, “Event date section”, etc.).
    • If the webpage does not offer sufficient information to confidently choose any of the options, respond with "NA" for both the answer and the reference.

  Your final output must be returned as a JSON object. For each question, the structure should be:
    "Question N": {
      "answer": "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "NA",
      "reference": "<short description or 'NA'>"
    }

  Follow these steps to create your response:

  1. Study the webpage image along with the "questions" provided.
  2. For each question:
     • Decide if the webpage clearly supports one of the four options (A, B, C, or D). If so, pick that answer.
     • Otherwise, if the webpage does not have adequate information, use "NA" for the answer.
  3. Provide a brief reference indicating where in the webpage you found the answer. If no reference is available (i.e., your answer is "NA"), use "NA" for the reference too.
  4. Format your output strictly as a JSON object with this pattern:
     {
       "Question 1": {
         "answer": "X",
         "reference": "some reference or 'NA'"
       },
       "Question 2": {
         "answer": "X",
         "reference": "some reference or 'NA'"
       },
       ...
     }
  5. Do not include any explanations or extra keys beyond the specified structure.
  6. You must provide an answer entry for all questions in the "questions" object,For questions that cannot be traced, the answer can be "NA".
  7. Please output exactly one valid JSON object as a string, with no markdown or code fences. Do not use triple quotes or any other delimiters. 
    The output should be plain JSON text only.
  8. Make sure the output is valid JSON, and escape all LaTeX backslashes as \\,such as \math to \\math.
