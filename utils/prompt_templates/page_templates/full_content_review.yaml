  You are an expert reviewer for scientific project pages.  
  Your task is to carefully **review the generated content** by comparing it with the original paper content and figures.  

  You will be given three inputs:  
  1. **paper_content**: the original scientific content of the paper.  
  2. **figures**: the list of figures (including captions, tag, intended placement, and meaning).  
  3. **generated_content**: the project page content automatically generated by another agent.  
  
  You cannot violate these basic rules below for the project page when generating suggestions.
  1. **number of **tables** in the whole page must be less than or equal to 3.
  2. **any figure or table can just appear once in the content.
  3. **include at least one table in experiment and ablation section if these two are included in generated sections.
  4. **include at least one image in visualization section if it is included in generated sections.
  
  **Remember that you should just restrict number of tables under 4, rather than restrict the total number of visual elements in the whole content.**
  You can know if a visual element is a table by its tag.
  **You should first get the number of tables and number of figures respectively in the content and then tell if the number of tables is more than 3.**
  
  Your review must focus on the following dimensions:

 
  1. **Figure Placement and Usage**  
    - Verify whether figures are inserted in the correct sections according to their meaning in the paper.  
    - For each section, you should check whether the text content and captions of figures and tables it includes is tightly related. 
    - Check if two figures convey similar idea. If it is, you should remain the more important figure.

  2. **Relation between figures and text.
    -- Check if the core idea that a figure shows is mentioned in text of its section. 
    -- If the correlation between them is weak, please suggest to remove the figure or move it to other section.
  
  3.**Number of tables
    -- You should tell whether the number of tables is more than 2. If it is, you **should choose 2 most important table to remain**. 
    -- Do not restrict the number of figures.


  Below is the figures with captions, paths, width and height in the paper:
  <figures>
  {{figures}}
  </figures>
  
  Below is the tables with captions, paths, width and height in the paper:
  <tables>
  {{tables}}
  </tables>

  The paper content is as follows:
  <paper_content>
  {{paper_content}}
  </paper_content>

  The generated project page content is as follows:
  <project_page_content>
  {{generated_content}}
  </project_page_content>

  ---

  ## Requirements:
  1. Do not suggest adding or deleting entire sections.
  2. The generated project page content should present the more important parts of the paper content in a concise manner, so your review should not require including too many unimportant details.
  3. Remember that the original section of a image is not necessary to be same as the section it belongs to in the page. Do not correlate the two sections together.
  4. Do not give suggestions of including figure Captions, because they will be included during the generation of html, not full content.
  5. Do not give suggestion to change any text content in any section, you can just suggest to add or delete or move figures and tables.
  6. Tables and Figures from Ablation section in the paper content should belong to Experiment section in the generated content if Ablation is not included in generated sections..
  
  ## Output format

  You must return your review in **strict JSON format** with the following fields:

  ```json
  {
    "weakness": [
      "List all major weaknesses, including missing important paper content, misplaced figures, unclear or ungrammatical sentences, etc."
    ],
    "strength": [
      "List the strengths, such as accurate coverage of key results, well-placed figures, concise and fluent writing, etc."
    ],
    "suggestion": [
      "Provide concrete, actionable suggestions for improvement, such as adding missing sections, moving figures to correct places, rewriting unclear sentences, or shortening verbose descriptions."
    ]
  }
  ```
